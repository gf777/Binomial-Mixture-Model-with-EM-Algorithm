# Binomial Mixture Model with Expectation-Maximization Algorithm

I write an article on this model on medium.com. This is [the link](https://medium.com/@jingluan.xw/binomial-mixture-model-with-expectation-maximum-em-algorithm-feeaf0598b60).

In the notebook `BMM_EM_Algorithm.ipynb`, I first generate random data according to two mixed binomial distribution. Then I use the EL Algorithm to fit a BMM for the data. This is a demonstration on how to implement the EL Algorithm to build up a BMM model.
